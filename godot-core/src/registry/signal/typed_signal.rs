/// Type-safe version of a Godot signal.
///
/// Short-lived type, only valid in the scope of its surrounding object type `C`, for lifetime `'c`. The generic argument `Ps` represents

///
/// See the [Signals](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/register/signals.html) chapter in the book for a general introduction and examples.
///
/// # Listing signals of a class
/// The [`WithSignals::SignalCollection`] struct stores multiple signals with distinct, code-generated types, but they all implement
/// `Deref` and `DerefMut` to `TypedSignal`. This allows you to either use the concrete APIs of the generated types, or the more generic
/// ones of `TypedSignal`.
///
/// You can access the signal collection of a class via [`self.signals()`][crate::obj::WithUserSignals::signals] or
/// [`Gd::signals()`][Gd::signals].
///
/// # Connecting a signal to a receiver
/// Receiver functions are functions that are called when a signal is emitted. You can connect a signal in many different ways:
/// - [`connect()`][Self::connect]: Connect a global/associated function or a closure.
/// - [`connect_self()`][Self::connect_self]: Connect a method or closure that runs on the signal emitter.
/// - [`connect_other()`][Self::connect_other]: Connect a method or closure that runs on a separate object.
/// - [`builder()`][Self::builder] for more complex setups (such as choosing [`ConnectFlags`] or making thread-safe connections).
///
/// # Emitting a signal
/// Code-generated signal types provide a method `emit(...)`, which adopts the names and types of the `#[signal]` parameter list.
/// In most cases, that's the method you are looking for.
///
/// For generic use, you can also use [`emit_tuple()`][Self::emit_tuple], which does not provide parameter names.
///
/// # Generic programming and code reuse
/// If you want to build higher-level abstractions that operate on `TypedSignal`, you will need the [`SignalReceiver`] trait.
